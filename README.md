# Decision Tree Classifier & Regression Model

This repository demonstrates how to implement both a Decision Tree Classifier and a Decision Tree Regressor using Python. The project includes data preprocessing, univariate and bivariate analysis, model training, testing, and saving the trained models as `.pkl` files. It also explains how to load the trained models and make predictions with new data.

## Overview
This project demonstrates the following key tasks:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzing individual features.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Visualizing relationships between features.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Training and evaluating a Decision Tree Classifier.
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: Training and evaluating a Decision Tree Regressor.
- **Model Saving**: Saving the trained models as `.pkl` files.
- **Model Loading**: Loading saved models and making predictions with new input.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `seaborn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pickle`

You can install the dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-tree-classifier-regressor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd decision-tree-classifier-regressor
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
This project works with any structured dataset containing numerical features and target columns for both classification and regression. Replace `'your_data.csv'` in the code with your actual dataset file.

### Example dataset structure:
- Features: `feature1`, `feature2`, `feature3`, etc.
- Classification Target: `target_class`
- Regression Target: `target_regression`

## Univariate & Bivariate Analysis
- **Univariate Analysis**: Visualize the distribution of individual features.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Visualize relationships between features and target variables.

Univariate analysis is performed using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`, and bivariate analysis shows the relationship between input features and target variables.

## Decision Tree Classifier
- We use the `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `scikit-learn` to train the model.
- The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and a classification report.
- After training, the model is saved as a `.pkl` file for future use.

## Decision Tree Regressor
- We use the `DecisionTreeRegressor` from `scikit-learn` to train the model.
- The model is evaluated using the mean squared error.
- After training, the model is saved as a `.pkl` file for future use.

## Model Saving & Loading
- The trained models are saved using `pickle` as `.pkl` files.
- These saved models can later be loaded to make predictions on new input data without retraining.

## Usage
To train and evaluate the models:
1. Replace `'your_data.csv'` in the script with your dataset file path.
2. Run the Python script to perform univariate and bivariate analysis, train the models, and save them as `.pkl` files:
   ```bash
   python decision_tree_model.py
   ```

To load the trained models and make predictions with new input data:
1. Load the models using the provided code.
2. Pass new input data (as a NumPy array) for classification or regression predictions:
   ```python
   new_input = np.array([[1.5, 2.5, 3.0]])  # Replace with actual values
   class_prediction = loaded_classifier.predict(new_input)
   regression_prediction = loaded_regressor.predict(new_input)
   ```

## Results
- The **classification** model’s accuracy and classification report will be printed.
- The **regression** model’s mean squared error will be printed.
- Example predictions for new input data will be shown.
